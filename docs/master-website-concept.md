## 3. Universal Page Structure (Applied to ALL SERVICE PAGES)

Use this for consistency and conversions.

Template Sections
1) Hero Section (headline + subheadline + 3–4 value props)
2) Short credibility bar (true facts/credentials)
3) Benefits section (6 concise bullets)
4) 4-step process timeline (clear, simple steps)
5) Results or outcomes (realistic, non-exaggerated)
6) 3 short testimonials OR success examples
7) FAQ (accurate + compliant)
8) Strong call to action (Book/Call/WhatsApp)
9) Footer trust elements (licenses, affiliations)

Implementation Notes
- Keep each section scannable (short bullets, clear headings).
- Maintain bilingual readiness: data-i18n attributes or mirrored EN/ES blocks.
- Include sticky mobile CTA bar (Call, WhatsApp, Book).
- Capture UTM parameters in forms (hidden fields) + consent checkbox.
- Add SEO schema: Service + FAQ + BreadcrumbList (and Organization on homepage).

## 4. Cleanup Rules (Delete From Old Pages)

Delete
- Old simplified paragraphs and repetitive descriptions.
- Fake or undocumented stats (e.g., “95% approval” in immigration).
- Promises outside our control (refunds, approvals, guaranteed outcomes).
- Long text blocks with no structure.
- Low-quality filler (“we are here for you always”).
- Any old phone numbers or outdated business names.
- Duplicate service explanations; multiple redundant CTAs.
- Incorrect legal disclaimers.

Replace
- Short, structured, modern information.
- Emphasize bilingual advantage and real experience.
- Emphasize ease, accuracy, and professionalism.
- Emphasize multi-service ecosystem.
- Emphasize local expertise + Dominican Republic connection.
